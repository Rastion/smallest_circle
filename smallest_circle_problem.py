    Given a set of points in the plane, find the circle with the minimal radius that contains all the points.

    Instance file format:
      - The first token is an integer representing the number of points.
      - Then for each point, two numbers (x and y coordinates) are provided.
    
    Decision Variables:
      - A list of two floats [x, y] representing the coordinates of the circle's center.
        The domain of x is set to [min_x, max_x] and y to [min_y, max_y],
        where these bounds are computed from the instance data.
    
    Objective:
      - Minimize the radius of the circle, where the radius is computed as:
          r = max_{point in instance} sqrt((x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2)
